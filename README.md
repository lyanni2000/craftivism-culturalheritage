# craftivism-culturalheritage
Repository for Purdue Honors College Scholarly Project completed code. This is the completed code used for my project.

#create_array
This file allows the user to digitize destruction data, either from the images that were processed in the project or from a created textile itself.

#plot_heatmap
This function plots the site destruction data of a 29x41 array.

#master_map
This data file contains all the digitized destruction data from Zaina and Nabati Mazloumi's (2021) study. 

#create_final_maps
If using the master_map data, this file will separate the master array into the three different factor types so that they can be plotted with plot_heatmap.
